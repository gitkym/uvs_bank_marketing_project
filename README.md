> ABC Bank is planning to introduce a new term deposit product for its customers, and they need to develop a model that can predict whether a customer will buy their product or not. To achieve this goal, they want to analyse the past interaction of customers with the bank or other financial institutions. The bank wants to use this model to understand the customers' behaviour and preferences regarding term deposits, and to determine which customers are most likely to buy the product. This will help the bank to focus its marketing efforts on those customers who are more likely to buy, resulting in a more efficient and effective sales process. Ultimately, the bank hopes to increase its sales and revenue through the successful launch of its new term deposit product.
